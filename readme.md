# FEMbot

A seed project for front end modules, with automated build.

To create a new project based on this, fork this repository and optionally transfer it to menapost-team. After cloning it, add this repo as an upstream remote so that you can retrieve updates and contribute fixes back here.

```
git add remote upstream <your git url for this repo>
```

When there is an upstream change that you want to incorporate, e.g. a new feature in the demo build script, you can merge from upstream:

```
git merge upsream/master demo/gulpfile.js
```

To make an improvement to this repo, push your changes to an upstream feature branch:

```
git push -u upstream feature-branch
```

Then submit a pull request.

## Usage

**Install**:

`npm install --save <git-url>`. Will only work on machines that have an SSH key to the repo, if the repo is private.

**Require**:

`var ExampleComponent = require( 'fembot' ).ExampleComponent;` where `fembot` is the name specified in the module's package.json. The exported object is defined in index.js.

```

## Demo

From `demo/dist`, run `gulp watch` to start the build. It will rebuild whenever there are changes.

Start a simple webserver in the demo dir to view the demo:

```
$ pythom -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Open a browser at localhost:8000.
